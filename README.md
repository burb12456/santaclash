Santa Clash is a fighting game inspired from the Super Smash Bros. series.
The game is a platformer where two players are fighting each other, the goal being to eject the opponent behind the edges of the map.

__Android only__ because of the implementation of the Bluetooth module that has to be platform specific.

## Modes
The game is multiplayer only via Bluetooth with a training mode against a stationary opponent.

## Buttons
`A` : Basic attack <br>
`B` : Smash attack <br>
`Fireball` : Launch a fireball (Santa gift) <br>

## Installation

## Issues
